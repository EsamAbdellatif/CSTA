# Status

1. Add own website links rather than CSTA home page web links
2. Add more pictures from NOVA chapter and NOVA CSTA Events

Time necessary to complete: 4-5 months; after CSTA is "up and running"
                            (just to ensure events take place in order to
                                        get photographs)
